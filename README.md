Genres of idles that you could crossover:
(A)RPG: Idle to generate an adventurer, get as far as you can, treasure upgrades your idle
RPG: Progressing through the RPG lets you invest idle points which let you skip RPG grind
RTS: Idle research type stuff for clash of clans type game
Factorio: create a factory, reap benefits of factory, spend idle points to improve
Tower Defense: Manage space between guns and idle, using some sort of exponential growth or something to make sure you can't move too easily
shooter: basically just RPG


The main benefit of an idle game is that you're more steering a ship for a cruise than flying a fighter jet. 
anti-idle is minigame focused
 - Each subsystem contributes a currency which is spent either locally or globaly
NGU is subsystem/resource focused, with large prestige sections
 - Multiple progression tracks (Adventure and bosses) along with each subsystem having its own track
Trimps is prestige focues
Factory is exponential growth/space usage focused
loop idle is focused on route planning + incremental benefit
Adventure capitalist is route planning almost entirely, and the decisions are usually self evident


For my game I want probability to be the focus, combining the best elements of gacha games (dopamine from getting rare drops) to idle games (general course setting)
 - Needs to have discrete, recognizable character AND/OR some sort of highly identifiable rolling system
    - Soccer spirits does this well: players, unique stones, potential seeds
 - Need to be able to adjust different aspects of probability
    - Frequency of rolls, range/deviation, number of rolls done at once that you can choose from, and how fat the tails are should all be accessable
 - Possibilities:
    - RPG type game. Collect characters in a "garden" type setting where you improve them, grow them, etc. Once per period (daily), you can take send them into a dungeon where you'll exhaust/lose them, but your depth/treasure will let you reroll later
    - Tower Defense, roll different towers that you can place on your battlefield, with once per period waves, and use the winnings/losings from a wave to roll for better towers
Brief outline of Ascencion Idle
  - Start off with world seed 0. A small village just finished its festival where the four bravest and most powerful people go into the dungeon that only opens once every 70 years (1 week?).
  - One of the party who succeeds may ascend to godhood, and a stranger will take his place, bearing gifts
  - The world proceeds over the next realtime week. 
  - The player can fork the world at any point, changing the world seed a bit, rerolling some probabilities (and can make intelligent decisions here)
  - The player can interact with a few things around the village in order to improve the villages stats
    - [ Cupid's Den ] Who loves who (cupid's arrow)
    - [ Town Garden ] which magic fruit grow in the garden and their effects
    - [ Baron's castle ] the town's economy?
    - [ The Smithy ] equipment
    - [ Wizard's Tower ] magical enchantments
    - [ Invisible Hand ] give specific commands to individual people, and make village plans
  - Later, the world can be spawned at 0 with abberations, drastically changing certain aspects of the game:
    - Oedapal relations
    - different climate
    - raids on the village
    - etc
  - People in the village have stats which determine their capacities
    - There are two kinds of stats each person has: potent stats and latent stats. 
    - Potent stats have two components: active and potential. They tell you what the character can actually do:
      - PWR / RFX / MTL are primary stats and determine the basic abilities of the character: Physical strength, reflexes, and mental capabilities
      - Most practical things are skills: garden tending, sword/mace/axe/barefist/whatever fighting, psionics, mental, piety, etc.
      - Skills inherit from parents, the people they're around most as children, 
    - Latent stats let you make some predictions about their children's inclinations:
  - Problems:
    - Uhhhh how do I make sure I'm not treating people (esp women) as breeding stock?
      - Incentivize free will somehow?
      - Ignore it?
      - Just remove cupid's arrow/whatever? (This would actually increase general variability)
      - Maybe just implement some level of behavior: people will marry / are attracted to people with similar traits
